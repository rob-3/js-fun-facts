Daily JS Fun Fact #36: Automatic Semicolon Insertion - the `return` bug

You may have heard that semicolons in JavaScript are optional. A more accurate version of that statement is that JavaScript has **automatic semicolon insertion** (ASI). In most cases, you can omit semicolons with no ill effects.

Unfortunately, the rules for ASI have some serious problems that can cause highly unexpected parses and lead to difficult to detect bugs.

```js
const getSomeData = () =>
{
  return
  {
    data: "all the data!",
  };
}
```

This code might seem like perfectly reasonable K&R style JavaScript, but there's a reason K&R style JavaScript isn't a thing. JavaScript "helpfully" inserts a semicolon.

```js
const getSomeData = () =>
{
  return;
  // this is just an unreachable block with an unused label
  // nothing to see here
  {
    data: "all the data!",
  };
}
```

> This "bug" is one reason K&R style isn't popular in JavaScript. It simply doesn't work.
