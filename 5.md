Daily JS Fun Fact #5: `arguments`

In JavaScript, you can call a function with more arguments than it asks for. If you do, one way of accessing those additional arguments programmatically is with the `arguments` `Array`like object.

```js
// here is a version of sum that can take any number of arguments
function sum() {
  let total = 0;
  for (const n of arguments) {
    total += n;
  }
  return total;
}

sum(1); // 1
sum(2, 2); // 4
sum(7, 3, 10, 4, 5); // 29
```

Note that `arguments` is an `Array`like object that isn't a real `Array`. It provides an iterator for use like above, a `length` property, and indexing (`arguments[1]`), but you cannot directly call `Array` methods like `.map()` on it. If you need an `Array`, you can use `Array.from(arguments);`.

Should you use this? In most cases, rest parameters (come back tomorrow!) offer a more modern and less confusing alternative to `arguments`, but you still may occasionally see `arguments` in older code.
