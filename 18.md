Daily JS Fun Fact #18: Arrow Function Pitfalls (part 3)

**Using an arrow function as a method**

This doesn't work for object literals.

```js
// wrong!
const obj = {
  bestLanguage: "JavaScript",
  getBestLanguage: () => {
    return this.bestLanguage;
  }
};

// right!
const obj = {
  bestLanguage: "JavaScript",
  // method syntax
  getBestLanguage() {
    return this.bestLanguage;
  }
};
```

The only case in which this works is in a class with the class fields syntax.

```js
class Plant {
  height = 10;
  grow = () => {
    this.height += 5;
  }
}
```

This causes every instance to have its own copy of the function, so it isn't recommended unless you need `this` to remain bound if it is divorced from the class.
