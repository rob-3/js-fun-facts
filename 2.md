Daily JS Fun Fact #2: The `==` Operator

`==` is the original equality operator in JavaScript. Also known as the "loose" equality operator, it checks reference equality for objects, and value equality for strings, numbers, and booleans. `==` will try to helpfully convert things that are "close" into the same type. For example:

```js
1 == "1" // true
true == "1" // true
null == undefined // true
[] == 0 // true
"" == [] // true
"" == 0 // true
[5] == 5 // true
```

Due to reference equality, arrays and objects are only equal if they are a reference to the same array or object in memory.

```js
[] == [] // false
{} == {} // false
[5] == [5] // false
{ a: 5 } == { a: 5 } // false

// but...
const a = [5];
const b = a;
a == b // true
```

In practice, this behavior is the source of many bugs, and you should almost never use `==` or the negated counterpart `!=` in JavaScript.
