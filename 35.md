Daily JS Fun Fact #35: JSON

**J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation, or JSON, is a data format based on JavaScript objects. You can pronounce it like "Jason" or, more commonly, "j-sahn".

It turns out that with a combination of JavaScript objects (key-value maps), arrays, and primitives like numbers and strings, you can represent essentially any data structure.

A modified excerpt of real JSON from https://metaweather.com/api
```json
{
  "consolidated_weather": [
    {
      "id": 5416829875912704,
      "weather_state_name": "Heavy Rain",
      "min_temp": 9.015,
      "max_temp": 14.145
    }
  ],
  "time": "2022-02-16T01:13:10.044584Z",
  "sources": [
    {
      "title": "BBC",
      "slug": "bbc",
      "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/",
      "crawl_rate": 360
    },
    {
      "title": "Forecast.io",
      "slug": "forecast-io",
      "url": "http://forecast.io/",
      "crawl_rate": 480
    }
  ],
  "title": "London"
}
```

Some notable differences between plain-old JavaScript objects (POJOs) and JSON are that JSON keys must always be quoted (this is optional for JavaScript objects) and JSON does not permit trailing commas or comments.

JSON is the lingua franca for APIs and data transfer on the Internet, even if you're not using JavaScript. However, JavaScript makes it especially easy to use JSON.

To encode a JavaScript object into a string of JSON, you can use `JSON.stringify()`. To decode a value from JSON to an object, you can use `JSON.parse()`.

```js
const lunch = {
  name: "Salad",
  components: ["leaves", "more leaves", "dressing"],
  // comments are valid
  // trailing commas are valid
  healthiness: 10,
};
const lunchJson = JSON.stringify(lunch);
lunchJson; // '{"name":"Salad","components":["leaves","more leaves","dressing"],"healthiness":10}'
const lunchAgain = JSON.parse(lunchJson);
lunchJson.name; // "Salad"
```
