Daily JS Fun Fact #34: Strict Mode (part 2)

**No more `with`**

Do you need to access tons of properties on a single object? Do you hate destructuring? Do you feel like debugging obscure JavaScript corner cases just isn't hard enough?

Consider using the `with` statement.

```js
function withTest(a, b) {
  with (a) {
    console.log(b);
  }
}
withTest({ b: 5 }, 6); // 5
```

`with` makes an object the default scope for looking up values. The unfortunate part is that if the variable binding doesn't exist in the object, instead of getting `undefined` or an error, JavaScript will look up other variables with that name.

This is highly confusing for humans, but also for your JavaScript engine. `with` makes certain JavaScript engine optimizations impossible because you can't know ahead of time if `b` is in `a` or if it refers to another variable.

Strict mode makes `with` a syntax error.

**Functions must be declared on the top level**

```js
const a = Math.random() > 0.5;

if (a) {
  function hello() {
    console.log('hello');
  }
} else {
  function hello() {
    console.log('goodbye');
  }
}

hello();
```

Horrifyingly, this will work in most JavaScript implementations without strict mode, and the function will be conditionally defined.
