Daily JS Fun Fact #38: `Array.sort()` behavior

`Array.sort()` has unintuitive behavior. By default, it will convert the array items to strings and do a lexicographic sort based on those strings.
```js
// wrong!
[9, 8, 10].sort(); // [10, 8, 9]
```
To sort in other ways, provide a comparison function as an argument that tells JS how to sort.
```js
// right!
[9, 8, 10].sort((a, b) => a > b ? 1 : -1); // [8, 9, 10]
```
Note that you must return a number greater than 0 if `a` should go first and less than 0 if `b` should go first. If you return 0, the items are considered equal and the original order is retained. This is especially pernicious if you return `true` and `false`, since `false` will be converted to 0.
```js
// wrong!
[9, 8, 10].sort((a, b) => a > b); // [9, 8, 10]
```
Also, `Array.sort()` returns a reference to the array even though it sorts in-place.
