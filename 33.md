Daily JS Fun Fact #33: Strict Mode

`"use strict";` is a magic string you can put in your JavaScript source code, usually at the very top, to make JavaScript a little more strict.

Unless you're writing JS into a vanilla JS file and aren't using any build tooling, `"use strict"` is likely already enabled. If you use ES6 modules (`import`/`export`), `"use strict"` is automatically enabled.

A highlight reel of changes with strict mode:

**Python style declarations throw**

```js
let aLongEasilyMisspelledVariableName = 5;
function changeVariable() {
  // JS: this isn't a typo; clearly you mean globalThis.aLongEasilyMispelledVariableName = 6;
  // aLongEasilyMisspelledVariableName is a completely different variable!
  aLongEasilyMispelledVariableName = 6;
}
```

This is valid JS, because assigning to an undefined variable will create a new variable attached to `globalThis` by default.

This silently punishes even the smallest of typos with the confusing consequence that a variable simply doesn't change when it should.

In strict mode, doing this will throw an error.

**0-prefixed Octal Literals**

Beginners often believe prefixing a number with 0 has no semantic meaning. However, without strict mode, this indicates an octal (base-8) literal.

```js
const a = 100; // a === 100; ok
const b = 010; // b === 8; ?!?!?!?
const c = 001; // c === 1; ok
```

This is extremely confusing, since for single digit values, it seemingly works fine. Strict mode makes number literals starting with 0 a syntax error.

**`this` is less insane**

`this` in functions defaults to `undefined` instead of `globalThis` in strict mode.
