Daily JS Fun Fact #33: Strict Mode

`"use strict";` is a magic string you can put in your JavaScript source code, usually at the very top, to make JavaScript a little more strict.

Unless you're writing JS into a vanilla JS file and aren't using any build tooling, `"use strict"` is likely already enabled. If you use ES6 modules (`import`/`export`), `"use strict"` is automatically enabled.

A highlight reel of changes with strict mode:

**Python style declarations throw**

```js
let aLongEasilyMisspelledVariableName = 5;
function changeVariable() {
  // JS: this isn't a typo; clearly you mean globalThis.aLongEasilyMispelledVariableName = 6;
  // aLongEasilyMisspelledVariableName is a completely different variable!
  aLongEasilyMispelledVariableName = 6;
}
```

This is valid JS, because assigning to an undefined variable will create a new variable attached to `globalThis` by default.

This silently punishes even the smallest of typos with the confusing consequence that a variable simply doesn't change when it should.

In strict mode, doing this will throw an error.

**0-prefixed Octal Literals**

Beginners often believe prefixing a number with 0 has no semantic meaning. However, without strict mode, this indicates an octal (base-8) literal.

```js
const a = 100; // a === 100; ok
const b = 010; // b === 8; ?!?!?!?
const c = 001; // c === 1; ok
```

This is extremely confusing, since for single digit values, it seemingly works fine. Strict mode makes number literals starting with 0 a syntax error.

**`this` is less insane**

`this` in functions defaults to `undefined` instead of `globalThis` in strict mode.

**No more `with`**

Do you need to access tons of properties on a single object? Do you hate destructuring? Do you feel like debugging obscure JavaScript corner cases just isn't hard enough?

Consider using the `with` statement.

```js
function withTest(a, b) {
  with (a) {
    console.log(b);
  }
}
withTest({ b: 5 }, 6); // 5
```

`with` makes an object the default scope for looking up values. The unfortunate part is that if the variable binding doesn't exist in the object, instead of getting `undefined` or an error, JavaScript will look up other variables with that name.

This is highly confusing for humans, but also for your JavaScript engine. `with` makes certain JavaScript engine optimizations impossible because you can't know ahead of time if `b` is in `a` or if it refers to another variable.

Strict mode makes `with` a syntax error.

**Functions must be declared on the top level**

```js
const a = Math.random() > 0.5;

if (a) {
  function hello() {
    console.log('hello');
  }
} else {
  function hello() {
    console.log('goodbye');
  }
}

hello();
```

Horrifyingly, this will work in most JavaScript implementations without strict mode, and the function will be conditionally defined.
