Daily JS Fun Fact #25: `this` in a `class`

`this` is one of the most powerful and unintuitive features in JavaScript. Multiple frameworks, design patterns, and language features have been built around abusing `this` or avoiding it.

We'll start from the beginning: understanding what `this` means in common contexts, then spend next week discussing pitfalls and workarounds.

The most common use of `this` in 2022 is in a class.

```js
class FruitSalad {
  constructor(contents) {
    this.contents = contents;
  }

  sortContents() {
    this.contents.sort();
  }
}

const fruitSalad = new FruitSalad(["banana", "apple", "grape", "kiwi"]);
fruitSalad.sortContents();
fruitSalad.contents; // ["apple", "banana", "grape", "kiwi"]
```

The constructor and methods can access `this`, similar to how Java and other languages work. If you stick to using `this` like this, you can severely limit the potential headaches.
