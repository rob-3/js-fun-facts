Daily JS Fun Fact #4: `Object.is()`

`Object.is()` is a third way to test equality in JavaScript. It behaves very similarly to `===`, but it handles `NaN` (not a number) and `+0`/`-0` (yes, there is a difference between the two) differently.

```js
NaN === NaN; // false
Object.is(NaN, NaN); // true
+0 === -0; // true
Object.is(+0, -0); // false
```

Confusingly enough, `Object.is()` doesn't treat objects any differently than `===`. There is no built in function or operator to recursively compare two objects by value; `==`, `===`, and `Object.is()` all use reference equality for objects.

When should you use `Object.is()`? As with many things in JS, almost never. The primary use case, as suggested by MDN, is in "the pursuit of certain meta-programming schemes, ... when it is desirable to mirror some of the characteristics of `Object.defineProperty()`".

Although you can use `Object.is()` to compare `NaN`s, MDN recommends to instead do

```js
isNaN(a) && isNaN(b);
```

to avoid potential bugs around `+0` and `-0`.
