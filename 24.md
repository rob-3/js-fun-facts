Daily JS Fun Fact #24: The Nullish Coalescing Operator

Another common issue is setting a default if a value is `null` or `undefined`.

One way this can be done is with the logical or operator `||`.

```js
const myVal = aPossiblyNullVariable || 10;
```

The issue is that `||` checks if a value is "truthy", and isn't strictly a `null`/`undefined` check. For example, the `""` and `0` are considered "falsy" and would cause the default to be set instead.

The nullish coalescing operator `??` is clearer and only is triggered on null or undefined.

```js
const myVal1 = "" || 10; // 10
const myVal2 = "" ?? 10; // ""
```

It also can be useful with optional chaining.

```js
const myVal3 = someObj?.someProperty?.someMethod() ?? "default";
```
