Daily JS Fun Fact #27: `this` by itself

```js
this; // what will we get?
```

Because `this` is supposed to refer to an object reference of some kind, you would expect using it without any objects or methods to give an error, or at least `undefined`.

In reality, JavaScript subverts your expectations and gives you something called the global object. In browsers, this is `window`, and Node has its own `global` keyword. These are objects that hold useful globals like `fetch()` or `setTimeout()`.

This behavior is the source of many nasty bugs, because the global object can have its properties assigned to like a regular object.

Things might seem to be fine (in this example, if you read from `this.hello` in another arrow function method, it would apparently work!), but assigning to the global object is almost never legitimate in modern JavaScript.

```js
const a = {
  setHello: () => {
    this.hello = "hello!";
  }
};
a.setHello();
a.hello; // undefined
this.hello; // "hello!";
```

> Remember: never use arrow functions as methods in an object literal!
