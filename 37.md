Daily JS Fun Fact #37: Automatic Semicolon Insertion (part 2): `(` and `[`

The other main source of issues comes from lines beginning with `(` or `[`. These lines will sometimes be interpreted as a function call or array indexing of the end of a previous line.

```js
// you write
let justGoingAboutMyDay = 5
[1, 2, 3].map(x => x + 1)

// JS reads as
let justGoingAboutMyDay = 5[1, 2, 3].map(x => x + 1)

// Which is equivalent to
let justGoingAboutMyDay = 5[3].map(x => x + 1)

// you write
let a = 5
let b = 6
let c = 7
(a + b).toString();

// JS reads as
let a = 5;
let b = 6;
let c = 7(a + b).toString();
```

The square bracket form will usually silently give you `undefined` and keep chugging until something breaks later in the line or function, while the parentheses version will usually immediately give you the legendary "______ is not a function" error.

You might think that commas would cause the array indexing to be invalid, but the *comma operator* exists and will evaluate something like `1, 2, 3` as `3`.
