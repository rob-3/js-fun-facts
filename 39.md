Daily JS Fun Fact #39: Factory Functions

Many programmers who come from other languages find `class` the most intuitive way to create new objects, but an alternative I'm fond of is a factory function.

A factory function is just a regular function that returns an object.

```js
function FruitSalad(contents) {
  return {
    contents,
    sortContents() {
      this.contents.sort();
    }
  };
}
const myFruitSalad = FruitSalad(["pineapple", "mango", "blueberry"]);
```

This has similar performance to classes and you don't have to use the `new` keyword. It also lends itself well to using composition instead of inheritance, since you can't inherit from a factory function.
