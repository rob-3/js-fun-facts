Daily JS Fun Fact #30: `this` and arrow functions

`this` is inherited from the lexical scope of the parent of an arrow function. Arrow functions "remember" this value and `this` will never be rebound after declaration in an arrow function.

One use-case I really like is arrow functions with public fields syntax.

```js
class FruitSalad {
  constructor(contents) {
    this.contents = contents;
  }
  sortContents = () => {
    this.contents.sort();
  }
}
const fruitSalad = new FruitSalad(["banana", "apple", "grape", "kiwi"]);
// it will be ok even if we divorce the function later
const { sortContents } = fruitSalad;
sortContents();
fruitSalad.contents; // ["apple", "banana", "grape", "kiwi"]
```

> This is the one situation where using an arrow function as a method is legitimate. In other situations, favor the method syntax `sortContents() {}`.

`sortContents()` is declared as an arrow function, so it will remember `this` as the original `this` during the class construction.

The consistency of `this` in arrow functions is one reason to use `const fn = () => {}` instead of `function` declarations; you are unlikely to fall prey to unexpected values of `this` when using arrow functions.

> For those who have used React, this is a way to get around `.bind()` in your class components.
