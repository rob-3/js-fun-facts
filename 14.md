Daily JS Fun Fact #14: Arrow Functions (part 1)

One extremely popular modern JavaScript feature is the arrow function. Arrows functions provide an alternative to traditional function expressions (though as we will see, they can also replace function definitions).

```js
5; // a number literal
"hello"; // a string literal
[1, 2, 3, 4]; // an array literal
function (a) { return a + 1; }; // a function literal!
(a) => a + 1; // an arrow function!
```

> Note: unary (1 argument) arrow functions can drop the parentheses for brevity (like `a => a + 1`), though some style guides and tools, like Prettier, don't take advantage of this. Either style is entirely valid.

Function expressions are most useful with higher-order functions: functions that take other functions as an argument. Just like you can pass `5` or `"hello"` to a function, you can pass `(a) => a + 1` to a function.

A common higher-order function is `.map()`.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// the old way of doing things
arr.map(function(a) {
  return a + 1;
}); // [2, 3, 4, 5]

// arrow function!
arr.map((a) => a + 1); // [2, 3, 4, 5]

// The name of the variable isn't important and we can change it.
// This is known as _alpha conversion_.
arr.map((aReallyLongButEquallyFunctionalVariable) => aReallyLongButEquallyFunctionalVariable + 1);
```
