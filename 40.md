Daily JS Fun Fact #40: `Object.freeze()`

If you actually want to make data immutable in JavaScript, you can use `Object.freeze()`.

```js
const fruitSalad = {
  fruit: [1, 2, 3],
  amount: 100,
};
Object.freeze(fruitSalad);
fruitSalad.amount += 100; // fail!
fruitSalad.fruit = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // fail!
fruitSalad.fruit.push(4); // success!
```

This will disallow you from directly assigning to an object or its properties.

In strict mode, an error will be thrown on attempts to modify the object, otherwise, the modifications will silently fail.

`Object.freeze()` does not work recursively; ie subobjects and arrays will still be mutable. However, libraries exist that do provide recursive variations of `Object.freeze()`.
