Daily JS Fun Fact #7: Spread Syntax With Arrays (or `...`, part 2)

The other use of the `...` syntax is the exact opposite of the first! While rest parameters allow you to collect the "rest" of the parameters into a variable, spread syntax "spreads" an existing array into multiple values. This dual purpose makes it easy to get lost in the syntax, but with some experience, it is easy to tell the two syntaxes apart.

Sometimes, you want to do something like this:

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3];
sum(array[0], array[1], array[2]);
```

Although this works, it's a bit clunky. Plus, we can't do this if we don't know the length of the array. Spread syntax solves these problems elegantly.

```js
sum(...array); // read as sum(array[0], array[1], ..., array[array.length - 1]);
```

You can also use spread syntax when creating an array.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3];
const b = [...a, 4, 5, 6];
const c = [4, ...a, 5, 6];
b; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
c; // [4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6];
```

A common (shallow) array copying idiom is

```js
const copy = [...arrayToCopy];
```

The easiest way to tell spread and rest syntax apart is their location. Spread only makes sense when we want to spread an existing array into multiple values, like in a function call or array literal. Rest, on the other hand, only makes sense if we want to collect an unknown number of values into one, like in function arguments or (as we will see), a destructuring assignment.
