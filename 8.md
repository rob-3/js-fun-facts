Daily JS Fun Fact #8: Spread Syntax With Objects (or `...`, part 3)

Spread syntax was so popular with arrays, that it was added to objects as well. Since objects aren't ordered, you can't do `sum(...myObj)`.

However, you can use `...` to copy key value pairs into a new object.

```js
const apple = {
  name: "apple",
  type: "fruit",
  color: "red",
  taste: "sweet",
};

const greenApple = {
  ...apple,
  color: "green",
  taste: "sour",
};
greenApple; // { name: "apple", type: "fruit", color: "green", taste: "sour" }
```

You can override properties by placing them later in the declaration body of the object. If you do multiple spreads, the properties are merged, with the second one winning.

A common (shallow) object cloning idiom is

```js
const newObj = { ...obj };
```
