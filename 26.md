Daily JS Fun Fact #26: Constructor Functions

A less common but interesting alternative to classes is the constructor function.

```js
function FruitSalad(contents) {
  this.contents = contents;
}
FruitSalad.prototype.sortContents = function() {
  this.contents.sort();
}
var fruitSalad = new FruitSalad(["banana", "apple", "grape", "kiwi"]);
fruitSalad.sortContents();
fruitSalad.contents; // ["apple", "banana", "grape", "kiwi"]
```

This is essentially equivalent to the `class` version from yesterday, and was the standard approach before `class` was added to JavaScript.

A variation is

```js
function FruitSalad(contents) {
  this.contents = contents;
  this.sortContents = function() {
    this.contents.sort();
  }
}
```
