Daily JS Fun Fact #17: Arrow Function Pitfalls (part 2)

**Returning an object literal**

Returning an object literal from a shorthand arrow function requires parentheses to disambiguate with a multiline arrow function.

```js
// wrong!
const getMeAnObject = () => { answer: 42 };
// right!
const getMeAnObjectRedux = () => ({ answer: 42 });
```

Believe it or not, the first is still valid JavaScript. It creates a block with something called a "labeled statement".

Here's an equivalent multiline version so you can see what is going on.

```js
const getMeAnObjectClarified = () => {
  // a useless label
  answer:
  // an expression statement
  42;
  // return undefined, as the JS gods intended
}
```
