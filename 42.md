Daily JS Fun Fact #42: Template Strings

Template strings offer a more readable and useful way to represent embedding variables into strings.

```js
// both of these give the same string
const myRegularOldString = 
  "Apples: " + appleCount + "\n" +
  "Oranges: " + orangeCount;

const myTemplateString =
`Apples: ${appleCount}
Oranges: ${orangeCount}`;
```

Template strings support arbitrary expressions ("4" === \`${2 + 2}\`), as well as newlines. One pitfall is that leading whitespace on a line is not stripped, and will result in extra tabs or spaces in the middle of your string.

I typically almost always use template strings when I'm building a string with variables, as they tend to be more clear and help make certain kinds of formatting much nicer.
