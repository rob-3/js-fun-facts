Daily JS Fun Fact #3: The `===` Operator

`===` is `==`'s lawful good twin. Known as the strict equality operator, it doesn't do any of the crazy type conversions if two things aren't the same type. Instead, it just says `false`, like you would expect.

```js
1 === "1" // false
true === "1" // false
null === undefined // false
[] === 0 // false
"" === [] // false
"" === 0 // false
[5] === 5 // false
```

Note that `===` also uses reference equality, so you cannot use it by itself to compare two arrays or objects, just like `==`.

In modern JavaScript, you should nearly always use `===` and the negated counterpart `!==` instead of `==` or `!=`. If you actually rely on the type coercions that the loose equality operators provide for your comparison to work, you probably should just do the type conversions yourself and use the strict operators.
