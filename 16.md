Daily JS Fun Fact #16: Arrow Function Pitfalls (part 1)

**`return` in multiline arrow functions**

It's easy to forget you need a `return` when converting to the multiline form of an arrow function. Not doing this isn't an error; your function will just return `undefined`.

```js
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
const sum2 = (a, b) => {
  a + b; // you need a return here now!
}
sum2(1, 2); // undefined
```
