Daily JS Fun Fact #41: class expressions

You can write a class as an expression and assign it into a variable. This is because a class in JavaScript is really syntax sugar for a factory function.

```js
const FruitSalad = class {
  constructor(contents) {
    this.contents = contents;
  }

  eat() {
    this.contents = [];
  }
};
const lunch = new FruitSalad(["dragon fruit", "pomegranate", "orange"]);
lunch.eat();
lunch.contents; // []
```

Generally, this feature isn't used, but one use for it could be classes that are dynamic at runtime.
