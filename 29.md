Daily JS Fun Fact #29: `globalThis`

If for some reason you're actually trying to use `this` in a way that references the global object, you can use `globalThis`.

One usage for `globalThis` is to polyfill functions that are new and aren't supported on older environments in a platform agnostic way. Before, polyfills would first have to detect if they were in the browser, Node, or a web worker to figure out the right global object to use.

```js
globalThis.structuredClone = globalThis.structuredClone || // polyfilled implementation
```

> You could use `??` here, but older environments might not have it, so `||` is a mostly compatible alternative that polyfills would probably use.

`globalThis` works even within an object context where `this` is something else.
