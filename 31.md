Daily JS Fun Fact #31: `.bind()`

You can manually override the value of `this` with `.bind()`. The original function is left unchanged, but `.bind()` will return you a new function you can assign to a variable or use immediately.

`.bind()` cannot bind `this` for arrow functions.

```js
const fruitSalad = {
  contents: ["grape", "apple", "kiwi", "banana"],
};
function sortContents() {
  this.contents.sort();
}
// this won't work
// sortContents();
sortContents.bind(fruitSalad)();
fruitSalad.contents; // ["apple", "banana", "grape", "kiwi"]
```

Libraries like jQuery are famous for binding `this` to useful values. You can essentially use it as a magic argument that isn't in the parameter list.

Modern wisdom is to avoid `this` when possible because of how confusing and subtle the rules are. One of the biggest touted advantages of React functional components was to remove reliance on `this`.
