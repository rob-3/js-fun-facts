Daily JS Fun Fact #15: Arrow Functions (part 2)

Some people like arrow functions so much that they use them to declare their functions too!

> It's interesting to note that this isn't a special syntax in JavaScript. Rather, it's simply a manifestation of the fact that functions are first class values that can be handled just like a number or a string.

```js
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
// multiline form
const sum = (a, b) => {
  const ret = a + b;
  return ret;
}
```

These `const`-style declarations do have several differences from regular `function`s. Some interesting ones are as follows:

1. `function`s have a dynamic notion of `this`; arrow functions do not. Don't use an arrow function as a method; `this` will probably not work as you expect.
2. `function`s can be reassigned; `const` declarations cannot.
3. `function`s have the `arguments` object; arrow functions do not. Use rest syntax!
