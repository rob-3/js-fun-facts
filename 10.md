Daily JS Fun Fact #10: Destructuring with Objects

You can also use a destructuring assignment with an object. You can rename properties as they are destructured, but there's a convenient shorthand if you want to retain the same property names.

```js
const person = {
  name: "Rob",
  age: 19,
  school: "UCF",
};

// A destructuring assignment with a variable on the RHS
let { name: myName, age: myAge, school: mySchool } = person;
myName; // "Rob"
myAge; // 19
mySchool; // "UCF"

// Same as let { name: name, age: name, school: school } = person;
let { name, age, school } = person;
name; // "Rob"
age; // 19
school; // "UCF"
```

Note that destructuring assignments that aren't declarations with objects must be wrapped in `()` (otherwise it be interpreted as starting a new block).

```js
// bad; won't work
{ name, age } = { name: "AJ", age: 15 }

// good
({ name, age } = { name: "AJ", age: 15 });
```

Finally, rest syntax can be used to collect any remaining properties in an object into a new object.

```js
const { school, ...rob } = {
  name: "Rob",
  age: 19,
  school: "UCF",
};
school; // "UCF"
rob; // { name: "Rob", age: 19 }
```
